Purpose
==========

Edit BCF on-site using Augmented Reality on mobile devices


What was done ?
=================

This usage of AR to create and edit a BCF comment is possible with a primary load of the Model on a mobile device such as a tablet.

At the office, the users store Models in DMS of BIMData Platform and explore the Models with BIMData Viewer. The users create and edit BCF with BIMData Viewer.

On the mobile device, the same Model is loaded in a tablet-specific viewer (based on Unity). 
The users log in the BCF Server using BIMData Connect and retrieve their BCF comments.
The BCF Server let any client-app retrieve BCF comments linked to any given Model. Then on-site, the users use AR to superpose Model to what they are viewing through the camera of the mobile device. The users can create and edit BCF comments to acknowledge the status of the building along the corresponding Model.
