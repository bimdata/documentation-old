How-to output your data for Excel export
==========================================

You have to export data and produce Excel files.
Let's help you to achieve your goal.

Define the fields
==================

According to your needs, begin with defining which columns will be in your datasheet.
Each column could be a raw field you get using BIMData's API or a computed data (aggregation, sum, etc.)


Write your query
=================

Depending on the data you want to gather, you may need one or several calls to the API.


Make the call
==============

For our example, this is the code you write:

.. code:: python
    
    #calls
    #code

You now have your data ready to be printed in a CSV file, or sent to your favorite Excel-file generator.
