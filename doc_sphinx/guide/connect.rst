BIMData Connect
===============

BIMData Connect is a Single Sign-On (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) system.


Managing users is complex and rarily provide business advantage. BIMData can handle it for you so you can focus on building nice features based on BIM.

BIMData Connect allows users (and developers) to share data between different applications (BIMData Platform to collaborate with other people, an On-Site mobile app to create BCF on-site, a specialized third party app for specific tasks, etc.)

BIMData Connect uses the standard OpenID Connect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) to provide the SSO.
It is used bu Google, Microsoft, Amazon and many other big companies. Therefore, there are plenty of libraries available (https://openid.net/developers/libraries/) and all blog posts speaking about OpenID Connect usage applies to BIMData Connect too.
