BIMData Connect
===============

BIMData Connect is a `Single Sign-On <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on>`_ system.

Managing users is complex and rarely provide a business advantage. 
BIMData can handle it for you so you can focus on building nice features based on BIM.

BIMData Connect allows users (and developers) to share data between different applications 
(BIMData Platform to collaborate with other people, an On-Site mobile app to create BCF on-site, 
a specialized third-party app for specific tasks, etc.)

BIMData Connect uses `the standard OpenID Connect <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect>`_  to provide the SSO.
OpenID Connect is used by Google, Microsoft, Amazon and many other big companies. You can choose amongst `plenty of libraries <https://openid.net/developers/libraries/>`_ available.
Note that every blog post and tutorials written about the OpenID Connect usage applies also to BIMData Connect.
