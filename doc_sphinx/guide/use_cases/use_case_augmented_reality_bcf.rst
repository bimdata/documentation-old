Purpose
==========

Edit BCF comments on-site and offline, using Augmented Reality on mobile devices


What was done ?
=================

This usage of AR (Augmented Reality) to create and edit a BCF comment is possible with a primary load of the Model on a mobile device such as a tablet.

At the office, desktop browser
-------------------------------

On their desktop computers at the office, the Users store Model in the BIMData Platform Document Management System.
Users explore Model using BIMData Viewer in their desktop browsers. 
When they need, users create and edit BCF comments in the BIMData Viewer.

On-site, tablet device
-----------------------

On the mobile device on-site, the same Model is loaded using a tablet-specific viewer (based on Unity).
The users log in to the BCF Server using BIMData Connect and access the BCF comments: their own and all the comments they can read.

The BCF Server features contain the capacity to let any client-app retrieve BCF comments linked to any given Model. 


On-site, the users build an Augmented Reality vizualisation by superimposing the Model to what they are viewing through the camera of the mobile device.
The users can edit, and create, BCF comments to acknowledge the status of the building along the corresponding Model.
