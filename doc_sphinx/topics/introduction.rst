Introduction
================

The Bimdata API is organized around `REST`_. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. 
We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. 
We support `cross-origin resource sharing`_, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code).
JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.


URL
================

The API URL is **https://api-beta.bimdata.io**
All API requests must be made over HTTPS. 

.. NOTE::
    Calls made over plain HTTP will respond a 302, redirecting to the same URL over HTTPS.

API Enpoint
------------
.. parsed-literal::
    https://api-beta.bimdata.io

Content-Type
================

Endpoints usually only accept ``application/json`` content type.
Endpoints used for files upload use ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` (aka form-data) content type.


Libraries
================

We're currently maintaining two external libraries:
* Our `external lib in JavaScript`_ 
* Our `external lib in Python`_. 

They are auto-generated from `our OpenAPI file`_ with `swagger-codegen`_.
