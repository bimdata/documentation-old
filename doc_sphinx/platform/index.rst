Platform User Guide
=================================


The Platform lets you have as many Clouds as you need.

In every Cloud, you can create as many Projects as you want.

Every Project is a place to share about a BIM project: in a Project, you could be Admin, User or Guest.

The features you can use could be limited by your Role on the Project.
