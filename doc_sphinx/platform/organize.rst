Once you are logged in BIMData Connect, you can create Clouds on the Platform.
In each Cloud, you can create Projects and manage diverse Documents.

Clouds

A cloud is a set of `projects`_ sharing the same configuration. 

At your first log in, you have already 2 Clouds existing:
* Demo Cloud
* your own personal Cloud

.. note:: 
    The Demo Cloud is a complete example and contains a Demo Project already populated with an IFC Model.

From the main screen of the BIMData Platform, using the buttons, you can:
 * search Clouds by name : the search is case-insensitive
 * re-order Cloud by name
 * create a new Cloud
 * remove a Cloud 

.. note::
    The Cloud card let you know how many projects are in the Cloud, and how many Users have access to this Cloud.

Projects
=========

A project is a place where IFC files and documents are stored. 

A project belongs in a Cloud.

From your Projects List screen, the Choice List let you navigate through your Clouds and your Projects.

From your Projects List screen, using the buttons, you can:
 * search Projects by name : the search is case-insensitive
 * re-order Projects by name
 * rename an existing Project
 * create a new Project
 * remove a Project 

On the Project's screen, the Viewer shows you information about your Models: Model Preview, Map with the surrounding, User's list, Documents of the Project.
From the Project's screen, you can invite Users (for more info, see Collaborate chapter), add Documents (see Add Content).

You can create directories to store and organize your Documents.
