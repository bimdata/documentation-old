Once you are logged in BIMData Connect, you can create Clouds on the Platform.
In each Cloud, you can create Projects and manage diverse Documents.

Clouds

A cloud is a set of `projects`_ sharing the same configuration. 

At your first log in, you have already 2 Clouds existing:
* Demo Cloud
* your own personal Cloud

The Demo Cloud is a complete example and contains a Demo Project already populated with an IFC Model.

A project belongs in a Cloud.
