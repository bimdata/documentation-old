=============================
Which app will you create?
=============================

The implementation of your app depends on your needs.
You can create several types of applications.

Frontend only application
==========================

Chose this way if you are developping a frontend-only application, ie an app for tablet or mobile.
In addition to that, maybe that your main programming language is Javascript.

Application with a backend
===========================

Without Users
-------------

Chose this way if your backend app has no Users.
Note that the application itself is a user.
=> `Create a backend app`_

With Users
-------------

Chose this way if your backend application is bound with Users credentials,
or if your users will be able to share your app's data with another app.
