Purpose
========

Use the Viewer to retrieve the reference of the documentation for a set of equipment gears.

The result
=============

From a list of UUIDs, we get the properties of elements.
Then, with the properties (name, brand, model), we search in an external database the reference of the user's manual.
Finally, we add an annotation to the element in the Viewer: this annotation contains the link to the the User's Manual of the device.
