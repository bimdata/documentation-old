Purpose
========

The BIMData Platform is forked and customized to suit the needs of the client. 


What was done?
==============

The client customized mainly the Projects feature: their project concept involve a in-house workflow. 
The client also uses their own data system plugged to the forked BIMData Platform.
BIMData Connect is used with as an ID Provider to log in the forked BIMData Platform.

The main benefit from this tailored Platform is a speed gain in developping new softwares, alongside the fact they can interact with other BIMData Platform-based applications.

Another customization is a new UI for render BCF in the BIMData Viewer. To suit their business needs, the client needs more fields in the BCF forms than the standard BCF Viewer feature offers.
